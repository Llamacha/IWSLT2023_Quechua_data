# IWSLT2023 - Low-resource Speech Translation Track: Quechua-Spanish Parallel Corpus

Repository for sharing the data in the Quechua language, one of the languages for the low-resource speech translation track at IWSLT 2023.

## Parallel data

This corpus is a small fraction of the Siminchik corpus [(Cardenas et al., 2018)](http://lrec-conf.org/workshops/lrec2018/W14/pdf/book_of_proceedings.pdf#page=28) translated into Spanish. It comprises 1 hour, 40 minutes of clean speech in Quechua, translated into Spanish (que_spa_clean). This version contains a validation and test data set.

## Additional Audio data

In addition to the 1 hour, 40 minutes of Quechua audio data aligned with Spanish translations, we also provided participants with a corpus of 60 hours of fully transcribed Quechua audio. All of this data comes from the Siminchik corpus.

Participants are not required to use any of this data.

Due to their size, this data is made available through this website.
